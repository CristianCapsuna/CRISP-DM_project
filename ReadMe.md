# A look into vehicle depreciation

## Installation

To be able to open and view the files you need Jupyter Notebook.

## Project motivation

I wanted to investigate the validity of some myths regarding car depreciation using real data. They are:
1. Do SUVs depreciate less than saloon/estates?
2. Does doing less milage reduce depreciation?
3. Does having a car with a bigger engine reduce depreciation?
3. Do some brands depreciate less than others?

## Tabel of content

1. BMW_analysis is my analysis of around 21,000 BMW car sale adds.
2. Jaguar_analysis is my analysis of around 5,000 Jaguar car sale adds.
3. BMW_ML is where I attempt to build machine learning models that can predict car pricing. I managed to build a regression model and a random forrest model. Bother had an R**2 score of over 90% for the test data set.
